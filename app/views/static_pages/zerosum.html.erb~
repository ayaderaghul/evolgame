Decision theory is the theory about how individual makes their decision. The central notion of this theory is the concept of a preference. To the point that I would claim: I prefer, therefore I am. I believe that the hallucinating experience of life starts when you start to know to prefer. In other words, at the beginning, God says: let there be preference.
